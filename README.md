# Linear-regression-case-study--VIF-calculation
In this project I am doing case study on insurance dataset using linear regression. I have calculated VIF (Variance inflation factor) value, RMSE, mean absolute percentage error(mape), box plot analysis, outlier removal, multicollinearity analysis, null data  transformation using mean, median and mode values.
